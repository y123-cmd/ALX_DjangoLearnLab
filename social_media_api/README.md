Project Documentation
Deployment Process
This guide outlines the steps required to deploy the project to a production environment, ensuring proper configuration and performance.

1. System Requirements
Ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu recommended) / macOS / Windows (via WSL)
Python: Python 3.x (preferably the latest stable version)
Web Server: Gunicorn, Nginx, or Apache for serving the application in production.
Database: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL, or MySQL for production (if using SQLite, skip DB setup).
Storage: AWS S3 for media file hosting (optional if using local storage).
Virtual Environment: It is recommended to use venv or virtualenv for Python dependency management.
2. Environment Variables
Set up the following environment variables in your production environment:

Variable	Description
DATABASE_URL	Database connection string (use SQLite or PostgreSQL)
SECRET_KEY	A secure key for Django's cryptographic signing
DEBUG	Set to False in production
ALLOWED_HOSTS	List of allowed domain names or IPs for your app
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (optional)	AWS S3 key for media storage
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (optional)	AWS S3 secret key for media storage
3. Deployment Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social_media_api.git
cd social_media_api
Set Up Virtual Environment:

If you're using venv, set it up and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:

Install all required packages from requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Database:

Run migrations to set up your database schema:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Collect Static Files:

Run collectstatic to gather static files for production:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py collectstatic
Start the Web Server:

If you're using Gunicorn with Nginx, start Gunicorn:

bash
Copy code
gunicorn --workers 3 social_media_api.wsgi:application
You may need to set up Nginx or Apache to proxy requests to Gunicorn.

Set Up File Hosting (Optional for AWS S3):

If you're using AWS S3 for media storage, ensure your S3 credentials are set up in the environment variables. Configure Django's DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE:

python
Copy code
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage'
Monitor Logs:

Ensure your log files are being written, and regularly monitor them for errors. Logs can be configured in settings.py as mentioned earlier.

4. Final Testing in Production
Once your application is deployed, perform the following tests to ensure everything works as expected:

1. Functional Testing:
User Registration: Ensure that users can sign up, log in, and log out successfully.
CRUD Operations: Test creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts, comments, etc.
API Endpoints: If your app has an API, test all endpoints to ensure they respond as expected.
2. Performance Testing:
Use tools like Apache JMeter or Locust to simulate traffic to your website and test its performance under load.

bash
Copy code
jmeter -n -t load_test_plan.jmx
3. Security Testing:
Ensure your application is secure by checking for common vulnerabilities such as:

SQL Injection: Ensure that your queries are parameterized.
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): Make sure that user input is sanitized and escaped.
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Verify that CSRF protection is enabled and working.
You can use tools like OWASP ZAP for automated security testing.

4. Uptime Monitoring:
Set up a service like UptimeRobot to monitor your website and receive alerts if your site goes down.

5. Routine Maintenance
Database Backups: Set up automated backups of your database to prevent data loss.

Software Updates: Regularly check for updates to your dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip list --outdated
pip install --upgrade <package_name>
Static File Management: Ensure that your static files are being served correctly by the web server and monitor disk space if storing them locally.

Security Updates: Apply security patches for Django and third-party packages promptly. You can subscribe to security mailing lists or use a tool like Dependabot to automate this.

6. Troubleshooting Tips
Database Issues: If you're having trouble with database connections, ensure the database URL is correct in the environment variables, and the database server is running.
File Permissions: Check if static and media files have the correct file permissions to be served by the web server.
Server Errors: Look at the logs for error messages that can help diagnose server or application issues.
